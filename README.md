# Mindfully Balanced Living App
This repository contains the source code for the Mindfully Balanced Living App, a learning project focused on app development fundamentals. The app is an extension of the paid course offered by a Pilates instructor and is designed to enhance the user experience through engaging audio and video content.

## Overview
The Mindfully Balanced Living App offers a range of audio and video content, including guided meditations and Pilates exercise videos. As this project is focused on learning app development, the emphasis is on understanding the core concepts rather than simplicity. The frontend is built using Flutter, while the backend utilizes a Strapi headless CMS. The project is a collaborative effort by Christian Maciosek and Niklas Schmidt, and the MVP is still in progress.
